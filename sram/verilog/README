OpTiMSoC Memory Implementation
==============================

This folder contains a common SRAM memory implementation for OpTiMSoC,
consisting of three parts:

- A generic implementation of a single port and a dual port memory
- A Wishbone bus interface
- Various memory implementations for different target architectures (e.g. BRAM
  for Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGAs)

The external interface complies to the Wishbone bus protocol version
3, especially with respect to memory addressing and burst modes.

All SRAM memory modules use word addressing and offer byte granularity
through the use of the "byte select" (sel) signal.

SRAM memories for the moment need to comply with the following rules:

  * single cycle access, meaning

         + cycle 0 + cycle 1 + cycle 2 +
    addr |<   A0   ><   A1   >----------
    dout |----------< D(A0)  >< D(A1)  >


Since most signals and parameters are common across the different modules, they
are explained here in one single place for your reference.

Parameters
----------
MEMORY_SIZE
    Memory size in bytes

AW
    Width of the address bus in bit, defaults to clog2(MEMORY_SIZE)

DW
    Width of the data bus in bit
    Allowed values: [valid: 8; 16; 32]

Calculated Parameters
---------------------
SW = DW / 8
    Width of the byte select signal.

Signals/Ports
-------------
addr[AW-1:0]
wb_adr_i[AW-1:0]
    Byte address to read from.
    Note: the actual used address is {adr[AW-1:clog2(SW))], {clog2(SW){1'b0}}.

sel[SW-1:0]
wb_sel_i[SW-1:0]
    Byte select. Each bit represents one byte in the output data.
    Note: The OpenRISC 1200 processor uses big endian encoding, which is also
        used in this signal, i.e. accessing the address 0x01 will result in
        sel[0] = 1 and sel[1] = 0 when using a 16 bit data port.


Memory Implementation Notes
===========================
All memory implementations (sp_ram_impl_* and dp_ram_impl_*) are expected to
have one cycle latency between setting the address and the data on the output.
